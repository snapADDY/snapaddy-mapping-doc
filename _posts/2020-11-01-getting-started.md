With snapADDY you can use the already existing out-of-the-box interfaces with your CRM system. The interface is plug'n'play. Just connect to your CRM system with one of the snapADDY products and directly create or update contact information for standard fields (such as name, company, address, â€¦). 

Many customers use custom fields or custom entities. If you want to export information that is not within the snapADDY standard, you can still do that: With an individual mapping, it is possible to connect to custom fields and -entities, you can realize custom functions for the snapADDY apps, or you can have information displayed differently in the snapADDY apps (e.g. show additional fields in the app).
